Beijing Forestry University (BFU), located in Beijing, is a national key university directly under the Ministry of Education and co-built by the Ministry of Education, the National Forestry and Grassland Administration, and the Beijing Municipal Government. BFU is a "Double First-Class" construction university and a "211 Project" institution. It is also part of the 985 Project Innovation Platform, the Excellence in Agriculture and Forestry Talent Education Program, the "2011 Plan", the National High-Level University Graduate Programs, the Chinese Government Scholarship for International Students, and the National College Student Cultural Quality Education Base. BFU is a founding member of the Beijing High-Tech University Alliance and the Silk Road Agricultural Education and Technology Innovation Alliance, and one of the first universities authorized to award doctoral, master's, and bachelor's degrees.
The university traces its roots back to the agricultural science program in 1902 at the Imperial University of Peking. In 1952, the forestry departments of Peking University and Hebei Agricultural College merged to form Beijing Forestry College. In 1956, the landscape architecture department of Peking University and parts of the architecture department of Tsinghua University were incorporated into the school. In 1960, it was designated as a national key university. In 1985, it was renamed Beijing Forestry University.
As of December 2023, BFU covers a total area of 13,176 mu (approximately 2,172 acres), with the main campus occupying 696 mu (approximately 115 acres) and experimental forests covering 12,480 mu (approximately 2,060 acres). The university has 17 colleges offering 65 undergraduate programs (including specializations), 7 first-level doctoral degree authorization points, 1 professional doctoral degree authorization point, 24 first-level master's degree authorization points, and 19 professional master's degree authorization points. The faculty includes 1,470 full-time teachers, and the student body comprises 27,608 students, including 13,779 undergraduates and 8,354 postgraduates (1,621 doctoral students, 2,699 academic master's students, 3,504 full-time professional master's students, and 530 part-time professional master's students). Additionally, there are 5,475 students in various continuing education programs.
A computer network refers to a system where multiple computers with independent functions and their peripheral devices, located at different geographical locations, are connected via communication lines and equipment. Under the management and coordination of network operating systems, network management software, and network communication protocols, these networks achieve resource sharing and information transmission.
Computer networks mainly consist of general-purpose, programmable hardware that can transmit various types of data and support a wide range of applications. Data communication is one of the primary functions of computer networks. It involves the transmission of data information between two terminals based on specific communication protocols and data transmission technologies. This can occur between computers, between a computer and a terminal, or between terminals. Data communication is the third largest communication service after telegraph and telephone services. The information transmitted in data communication is represented in binary data form, and it is closely associated with remote information processing, including scientific computing, process control, and information retrieval.
Resource sharing is one of the main purposes of establishing computer networks. Computer resources include hardware resources, software resources, and data resources. Sharing hardware resources can improve equipment utilization and avoid redundant investments, such as using a network to establish a network printer. Sharing software and data resources can fully utilize existing information resources, reduce labor in the software development process, and avoid the duplication of large databases.
The development and application of computer network technology have revolutionized modern office methods and business management. Today, many management information systems and office automation systems have been developed. These systems enable centralized management of daily work, improve work efficiency, and increase economic benefits.
Network technology development has made distributed computing possible. Large tasks can be divided into many smaller tasks, completed by different computers, and then integrated to solve the problem. Load balancing refers to the even distribution of work across the network's computer systems. The network control center is responsible for allocation and monitoring, automatically transferring loads to less burdened systems when one system is overloaded.
In conclusion, computer networks significantly expand the functionality of computer systems, broaden their application scope, enhance reliability, provide convenience to users, reduce costs, and improve the performance-to-price ratio.
